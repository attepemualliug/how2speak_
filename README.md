This project is a website to translate a japanese word or a piece of a sentence to it's equivalent in french.
The project use Vue.js for the front and the API MyMemory - Translation Memory for the translation. 

We used template on the interface to segment the different display, so that we can call them in a generic manner

## Project history

They decide to learn to speak and read japnese to achieve their ultimate goal going to japan.
For this they decide to use an application called Duolingo but to their misfortune this app can only make someone lear japanese if the language of the app is set in english.
